README for CS 265 LSM Tree Implementation 
------------------------------

AUTHOR: Lulu Li


INSTALL
------------------------------
To compile: 
	make 

To run:
	./concurrent_main NUMBER_OF_RECORDS DELETE_FREQ READ_FREQ SKEW_WRITE SKEW_READ

	NUMBER_OF_RECORDS	number of records generated
	DELETE_FREQ		probability of delete in records generated, range 0 to 100 percent. 0: no delete. 100: all delete
	FREQ			read delay, range 0-6. 0: no read. 1: 1 sec delay. 2: 0.1 second delay ... 6: 1 microsecond delay
	SKEW_WRITE		ignore, not a tunable parameter in this implementation 
	SKEW_READ		ignore, not a tunable parameter in this implementation

	for example: run 10 million records with probability of 10% delete, with a delay of 1 microsecond 
		./concurrent_main 10000000 10 6 0 0	

To remove: 
	make clean
